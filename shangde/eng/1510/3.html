一二三:
Have a Safe Trip(旅游) (一路顺风)

1.People visit other countries for many reasons.Some travel on business;
others travel to visit interesting places that are only found in other countries,
such as the Taj Mahal (泰姬陵) in India, orthe temples(寺庙) of Thailand.

2 Wherever you go, and for whatever reason,it is important to be safe.
A tourist can attract a lot of attention from local(当地) people.
While the majority of people you will meet when traveling are sure to be friendly and welcoming,
there are dangers-theft being the most common. Just as in your home country,
do not expect(期待) everyone you meet to befriendly and helpful.

3 As you prepare(准备) for your trip, make sure youhave the right paperwork.
You don't want to get to your destination(目的地) only to find you have the wrong visa(签证), or worse,
that your passport(护照) is about to expire(期満、失效). Also, make sure you travel with proper medical insurance(保险),
so that if you are sick or injured during your travels, you will be able to get treatment(治疗/对待).
If you want to drive while you are abroad(在国外), make sure you have an international(国际的) driver' S license(许可证).

4 Buy a guidebook and read about the local customs(习俗) of the country you are going to.
Do as the Romans do, and you will save yourself a lot of trouble(困难).
Besides, learning in advance(提前) can help you understandthe local culture better when you are there. Also,
try to learn a few basic(基本的) words and phrases(短语) don't assume(认为) that the local people will speak your language.

5 When you get to your destination, use official(官方) transport(交通工具).
Always go to bus and taxi stands; don't accept rides from strangers who offer you a lift. 
If there is no meter (表) in the taxi, agree on a price before you get in.
If you prefer to stay in cheap hotels(旅店) while traveling, make sure you can lock(锁) the door of your room from the inside.
If you are traveling with valuables such as jewelry(珠宝), or а lot of cash(现金),
you shoul dask about a safe(保险箱 ) for storing them in.
