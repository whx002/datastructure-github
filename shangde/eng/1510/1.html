Henry Ford

Many people believe Henry Ford invented(发明) the automobile (摩托车).
But Henry Ford did not start to build his first car until 1896.
That was eleven years after two Germans developed the world's first automobile.
Many people believe Henry Ford invented the production line that moved a car's parts(零件) to the worker,
instead of making the worker move to the parts. That is not true, either.
Many factory owners used methods of this kind before Ford.
What Henry Ford did was to use other people's ideas and make them better.
And he made the whole factory a moving production line.
In the early days of the automobile,
almost(几乎) everycar maker race(竞赛) his cars. It was the best way of gaining(获得) public notice.
Henry Ford decided to build aracing car. Ford's most famous race was his first one.
lt was also the last race in which he drove the car himself,
The race was in 1901, at a field(田野) near Detroit. All of the most famous cars had entered(参加),
but only two were left: the Winton and Ford's. The Winton was famous for its speed.
Most people thought the race was over before it began.
The Winton took an early lead. But halfway through the race, it began to lose power(控制力/动力).
Ford started to gain. And near the end of the race, he took the lead.
Ford won(赢得) the race and defeated(击败) the Winton.
His name appeared(发表) in newspapers and he became well-known all over the United States.
Within weeks of the race, Henry Ford formed(创办) a new automobile company.
In 1903, a doctor in Detro it bought the first car from the company.
That sale(出售 == selling) was the beginning of Henry Ford's dream.Ford said,
"I will build a motor car for the great mass of people. lt will be large enough for the family,
but small enough for one person to operate(操作) and care for. It will be built of the best materials(材料).
It will be built by the best men to be employed(雇佣).
And it will be built with the simple stplans(步骤) that modern engineering(工程) can produce.
