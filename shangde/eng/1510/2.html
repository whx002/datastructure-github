Body language
Body language is the unspoken communication that goes on in every face-to-face encounter(接触) with another human being.
it tells you their true feelings towards you and how well your words are being received.
Between 50- 100% of our message is communicated through our body language.
Only 7-10% is the result of actual(真实的) words we use in a conversation(交谈).

Eye contact(联系) is one of the most important ways of dealing with others, especially(尤其) people we've justmet.
Keeping good eye contact shows respect and interest in what they have to say.
In the UK, people tend to keep eуe contact around 60- 70% of the time.
(However, there are wide cultural(文化) differences,so be careful in other countries.)
Вy doing this, you give them a feeling of comfort(舒适) and real warmth.
Otherwise, they will feel you are lacking(缺乏) interest in them or their conversation.
Head position is a great one to play around with yourself and others.
When you want to feel confiden(自信) tand self-assured(自信), keep your head level both straight(水平/直) and upright(垂直).
You can also use this straight head position when you want to be powerful and what

you're saying to be taken seriously(被重视). If you want to be friendly,
tilt (倾斜) your head just a little to one side or other.
Hand gestures are so many and varied(各式各样的) that it's hard to give a brief(简单) guide(引导 == lead),
but here goes. Palms (手掌) slightly(稍微) up and out ward is seen as open and friendly.
Palm-down gestures are generally(通常) seen as commanding(命令), emphasizing(强调) and possibly aggressive(挑衅的).
This palm-up, palm-down is very important when it comes to hand shaking(握手) and we suggest you always offer a
hand shake upright, which should convey(传送) equality(平等).

Distance(距离) from others is crucial(重要的) if you want to give off(发出) the right signals.
Stand too close and you'll be marked as "stubborn" (顽固的棘手的).
Stand or sit too far away and you'll be "keeping your distance".
Neither is what we want, so observe(注意) how close all the other people are to each other if in a group.
Also notice if you move closer to someone and they back away(逐渐后退).
You're probably a bit too much in their personal space, their comfort zone.
