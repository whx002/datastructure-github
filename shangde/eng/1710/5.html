My Major Problem
Decision-making is something I struggle with. Infact,
l'd rather have someone else make decisions for me.
As I sat in a crowded information session(会议)at a college last summer,
I was again faced with the pressure of making a decision.
（The admissions officer asked us to introduce ourselves briefly.）
He then asked each of us to give our intended major. I looked at my mother with panic.
A major?" I said. "I can' t even decide what socks to wear to school!
I wanted to say I was undecided. But as my turn to speak approached, my confidence decreased.
（Everyone before me had declared a major.）
I watched the girl in front of me. She was searching for some obscure(鲜为人知的) major.
I realized I couldn't just say undecided. So,when my turn came,
I uneasily said, "I want to major in business I could feel"liar" written all over my face.
（In the end, only one brave person said she was undecided.）
I felt ashamed. "Why couldn't I have said that?""
I thought. The admissions adviser even said that a lot of people are uncertain.
That is why students have to decide until the end of the second year.
I have no idea what I want to do with my life.
All I know is that I don't want to do anything that involves blood.
（So l've narrowed my list down to anything but medicine.) This isn't really narrowing it
down l've been told many people start college withone major,
and graduate with agree in something totally different.
After my experience at the information session,
I've learned not to be afraid of saying I'm "undecided."I know now that I
am not the only one uncertain about future studies. I'm still experiencing a "major" problem.
（However, l'm confident l'll find a solution.）

Admissions advisors help you to make decisions.
