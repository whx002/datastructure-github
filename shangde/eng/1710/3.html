A Fighting Lady (4) （4.5）

Deborah Sampson was born in 1760. There were many children in her family and they were poor.
When Deborah was just a young girl, her father left and went off to sea.
Being in poor health, her mother could not care for her children. So she sent them
to live with different relatives, hoping these people would take care of her children.

2Young Deborah, less than seven years old, had to work for a farmer. On the farm,
she learned toride and hunt. She did housework as well. Life was difficult,
but Deborah worked hard and grew strong. The farmer had ten sons,
and Deborah helped to take care of them. In the evening,
she had the boys talk about their lessons with her. By this she learned what they learned.
She also borrowed their school books to read every night. When she was 18, Deborah became a teacher.

Soon after she started her new career, the American Revolution began.
She wanted to fight for her country, but women could not be soldiers at thattime. Deborah had
a plan. She was tall for a woman ofthat time. She made herself a man' s suit
and secretly practiced walking and talking
like a man. Finally, she joined the army using the name Robert.

"Robert" was a brave soldier. He fought with
courage in every battle, and other soldiers respected him.
They never suspected that their fellow soldier was a woman.
Once he caught a fever and had to go to the hospital.
There a doctor found out that Robertwas actually a woman. Deborah then had to leave the army,
but she was not punished. Some people say sheeven met General George Washington before she left.

Later, Deborah married a farmer and had three children. She taught in school and gave lectures
about her time in the army till retirement. Deborahdied at the age of 66. She was a true American hero.
