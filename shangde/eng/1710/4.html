Choosing Friends

In our daily life, it's nice to have friends. While family is（extremely）important, friends are a
different support system of your choosing. As the（saying） goes, "You can't choose your
family, but you can choose your friends. "Choosing them wisely can （make）
your life more exciting and inspiring.
Deciding whom you choose as your friends says as much about you as it does them.
You may choose your friends (based) on similar interests. You
may choose them because you're opposites（对立） of each other and find this interesting.
Often, friends become"friends" because
they are naturally（自然地） attracted towards each other due to (similar) personalities.
Sometimes it's just circumstances（环境） that bring two individuals（两个） together（在一起） who then become friends.
Whatever prompts a friendship, developing one is a very (rewarding) experience.
This is especially（尤其） true when, before you know it, a certain (relationship) turns into a unique（独一无二）
lifelong close friendship. Again, it's been said that a person (normally) has only a couple
of very close friends in their life. Think of whom you (consider) as truly（真正的） close friends. These are
those few individuals you can (trust) and share（分享） deep thoughts and concerns（关切） with.
