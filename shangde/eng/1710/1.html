My Writing Teacher （6）

English writing was always easy for me, but that changed on the first day I walked into Mrs.
Johnson's class. Before that, l'd heard rumors from former students.
They said she was strict and her class was hard to pass. So Iwas very nervous.
The first time we met, Mrs. Johnson told us her class would be difficult,
but she would give us new"tools" and guide us
through. She explained that her grading system was different, and that we would
not see high scores soon. "Everything you do in classmatters," she said. "
As writing is an art, it takes a longtime to perfect.
Mrs. Johnson scared me. I was afraid of what she would say if I asked a question.
So in class I kept silent most of the
time and couldn't follow her. WhenI got my first essay back, my grade was terrible.
I was annoyed with Mrs. Johnson. I disliked going to herclass.
Then I realized I needed to find out what I could do to improve my grade and how
to use the' 'toos" in my writing. As I still didn't dare to talk to Mrs.
Johnson in person, I e-mailed her. In this way, she and I worked to get her to improve my writing.
By andby, I could talk to her both online and in person.
She walked me through every step to understand how to write an essay.
To get her we saw improvement in mywork.
From this I discovered that asking for help could actually work.
Behind everything Mrs.Johnson was saying, she actually
cared about me and where would be in the future.
She knocked me down so that I could climb back stronger.
