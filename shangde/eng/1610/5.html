things. And, in fact, failure is a () part of growth. Life is filled with （试验） and()
In order to walk the path to (), you need to make some () turns（转弯） along（沿着） the way.
What I learned was to "fail forward",to () each mistake（错误） to make myself better.
One of the () problems people have with failure is that they are too quick to judge（判断） isolated（孤立的）()
in their lives and label them as failures. (), they need to keep the
bigger picture in mind. A successful baseball playerdoesn't () at a mistake he makes and
think of failure. He sees it with in the context（背景） of the bigger picture（局面）.
