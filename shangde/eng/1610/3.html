How to Protect（保护） the Art of Public（公众的） Speaking
If you want to become the type of speaker you've always wanted to be, read the following（以下） suggestions（建议）.

1.You can't go from a nervous（担忧的） speaker to a star speaker overnight. You shouldn't expect to(期望).
Give yourself time to get used to a large audience（观众）.
Start with smaller groups and get as much feed back(反馈) as you can. Keep on practicing（练习） and developing your skills.

2Be familiar（熟悉） with your speech materials（材料）. That doesn't mean memorizing（记住） your speech,
which can lack（缺乏） enthusiasm（热情） and naturalness（自然）. Know your key talking points（交谈要点）,
supporting details（细节） and ways to move from one point to the next.

3Positive energy can be passed（传递）. If you're excited（激动） and enthusiastic, your audience will be, too.
You'll be surprised at the positive cycle（良性循环） that creates:
An enthusiastic audience can add even more energy to you.
Use hand gestures（手势）. When appropriate（适当）, smile,smile, smile.

4.Find friendly, interested faces in the audience and speak to them. Look into their eyes.
It helps prevent you from staring off into（凝视） the distance（远方） or reading from notes.
lt also helps make you feel like you are talking in a conversation（交谈） rather than speaking to a group（集体）.

5.When you look great, you feel great. That makes you confident（自信）. Looking great doesn't mean wearing new clothes.
lt means wearing clothes and shoes you feel comfortable and appropriate to the setting（环境）.
You can't go wrong with business suit（西装）. Simple（简单） is fine（领人满意）,
but you should look clean from head to toe（脚）.
