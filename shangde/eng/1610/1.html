Being "Cool" in Middle School
A new study shows that gentle(文静) and quiet kids in middle school will grow up to rule.
Or, at least, they'll live healthier and more productive lives than the "cool" kids will.
The study looked at 13-year-olds who acted（行为） old for their age by having "cool" behavior,
such as early romantic（恋爱） relationships. They were seen as"cool" and popular kids.
But as they grew up, things changed.
The study found that these kids tended to have problems with drugs（吸毒） and relationships by their early 20s.
Their behavior was no longer linked with popularity.
Instead（然而）, they were thought to be less socially（社会） skilled by their peers（同事、平辈）.
Besides（除此之外）, the average（平均） "cool" kids, by age 22,
did more poor（贫瘠） than the average（普通） kids in the study.

They had a 45 percent（百分之） greater（较大的） rate of（...比例） problems due to（由于） drugs and alcohol（酒精）.
They also had a 22 percent greater rate of criminal（犯罪） behavior.
The study also found that these kids failed to develop important life skills.
They spent so much time trying to seem cool.

They didn't develop the skills needed for meaningful(有意义的) friendships.
The study followed 86 male（男） and 98 female（女） middle school students for a 10-year period（时期）.
It has some surprising findings. In particular,
the study notes（说明） that the so-called "cool" behavior is a predictor (预示) of future（未来） problems with drugs
and alcohol. In fact, it is a better predictor than drug and alcohol use in middle school. However,
one conclusion（结论） of the study is welcome.
Researchers said that parents shouldn't worry too much if their kids don't seem that popular.
If a kid prefers to spend Saturday nights at home watching a movie or reading instead of going out with friends,
that is not a cause for concern（担心）. Many "uncool" kids, they said, do much better later on than the popular kids do.
