lt is estimated（估计） that there are more than 8 million（百万） restaurants（餐厅） in the world today.
So it might surprise you to learn that restaurants as we know have only existed（存在） for a few centuries（世纪）.
Before 1765, there were no restaurants. There was now here in
which a server brought（带来） you food and drink that you chose from a menu（菜单）. In fact,
there was no menus anywhere. There were places where travelers(旅行者) could eat centuries before that.
The countryside（乡村） was full of inns（小旅馆） that would serve food.
And there were bars（酒馆） whereone could get a drink. T
he rich（富裕） could also eat meals supplied（提供） by private（私人的） cooks（厨师）.
But there was nothing that could be called a "restaurant".
A French man changed that. In 1765, he opened a place in Paris that sold（卖） soups（汤店）.
On his sign, he used the term "restaurant" to describe（描述） what he was selling（销售）.
Soups were considered（被认为） "restorative（恢复健康）", so he called them "restaurants".
Finally, people started buying his soups even when not ill（有病的）.

And as time went on, people began to use the term "restaurant" to refer（描述） to the
place where soup was sold rather（而不是） than the soup it self.More "restaurants" opened up in France,
and people began to buy soups more regularly(经常).
Then, restaurants in Paris began to serve food other than soups. In the 1 780s,
menus started to appear. by the 1800s, there were many types of restaurants,
and the restaurant concept(概念) was spread throughout(遍及) the British Empire.
A slow（缓慢） start gave way to rapid（快速） growth. Cities and towns around the world are filled with restaurants
today, It is estimated that there are 1.6 million
restaurants in Europe. In America, there are nearly a half million restaurants.
