Protecting the Few

How we live our lives affects the environment. The environment is all the things around you.
All across Earth, humans are changing the environment in small and large ways.
We cut down trees to build houses. We plow fields to grow crops.
We pour waste into rivers, lakes and oceans.
We use larger nets and bigger boats to catch huge numbers of fish.
Activities like these affect plants and animals.They aslo affect things like the soil and water.

Sometimes our actions make the number of a certain plant or animal get larger. For example,
if you planted roses in your yard, there would be moreroses in your area.
Our activities can also to a smaller number of a lead plants and animals.

If a park were turned into an apartment building,
what would happen to the plants and animals there? Well, they would either die or move to other places
There would be fewer plants and animals.

Pollution and other activities sometimes cause the number of a species to become so
small that it cannot survive. A species that is
in danger of dying out is called an endangered species.
