Grandpa My Hero
My grandfather had only one child and that was mymother. 
He always wanted a son but it never happened.
When my mom got pregnant, he thought he finally had a boy in the family,
but it turned out that her first child was my older sister.
When I was born, Grandpa was very happy.
He was the first person to give me a baseball glove and to play baseball with me.
My first glove was as small as my whole hand is now. When Grandpa gaveme that glove, 
I was very excited. It was my pride and joy.
When Iwas five, I played on my first baseball teamand Grandpa was the coach.
He wanted me to play one position, but I wanted to play another.
tried so hard that I made good progress. Grandpa wasvery proud of me.
Ever since then, he has worked with me to make me a better player.


Grandpa has helped me become not only a better player, but a better person.
Today Grandpa does not play baseball with me so often, 
bu the still comes to every practice and game. He sits
and watches my practices through rain and shine.
I love him and hope he will be around
for many more years to support me and baseball.


1 was so happy I even slept with it at myside.
He wanted a son because he wanted toteach him to play baseball.
I owe him all my success in baseball and inmy life.
In order to make me happy, he let me playwhat I wanted.
He was named our baseball team's number one fan by my coach.
My grandpa is still working at a store.
