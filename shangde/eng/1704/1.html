The Thinking Habit That Changed My Life
I remember one evening three years ago,
when my life was very different. I was overweight. I was deeply（非常） in debt（欠款）. I was a smoker.
I felt hopeless and helpless. I couldn't change anything.
Then I looked up（仰望） at the sky and thought what amiracle（奇迹） life is.
And I resolved（决定） to list the good things in my life. I had a
wonderful（极好的） wife. I had five amazing（了不起的） children.
I could see and appreciate（欣赏） the beauty（美丽） of the world around me.
The list went on, but you get the idea. Even when things seemed terrible（糟糕） for me,actually I was OK.
That night I resolved to be grateful（感激） for what I had,and for the people in my life.
I started the habit of gratitude. Now many people consider（认为） it unimportant.
I'm here to tell you that it's very important. It changes lives.
Now I appreciate my wife Eva more. I feel good about having her in my life.
And we have deepened（加深 {closer(靠近，紧密)}） our relationship. I also appreciate my kids more.Instead of（而不是） criticizing（批评） them,
I tend to notice（注意） their loveliness（可爱）, curiosity（好奇） and humor（幽默）. I'm kinder（更友好的）
to others around me, at work and everywhere else, because instead of（不要） seeing the faults（错误） in everyone,
I see the good, and I am grateful for them. I need less,
because instead of（不要） thinking about what I don't have, I am
grateful for what I do have. Each and every moment（每时每刻） becomes cause for（...原因） gratitude(感谢),
and life becomes easier.Without the habit of gratitude, we tend to
complain（倾向于抱怨） and see the bad in people and things. We can't change that all once, but you can do something.
For example, you can start with a small action. Really feel the happiness that
something or someone is in your life, or take a moment to
make a list of the things in your life that you're thankful for.
