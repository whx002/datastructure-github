Dog Training

Dog training（训练） is a must for all dogs. It is more than just telling your dog to stop doing what he's doing;
it is the process of（...通过） teaching a dog to exhibit（表现） certain（某些/必然的）
desired（预期） behaviors（行为） in specific（特定的） circumstances（情况/环境）.
Proper（适当） dog training is not a "quick fix "it is an ongoing（持续） process.
Dog training also involves（包括） teaching the owner.
Going through dog training is something that every dog owner should do. lt
is like going to school over again. lt is all about communication, and you need to
learn to communicate with your dog.
Training your dog to "sit" is probably the first thing you will train your dog to do.
When you want your dog to sit, hold a treat（食物） above(超过) his head and say "sit". As the dog sits,
say "sit" again and then immediately（马上） give him the treat（奖励）.
Your dog should dropinto a "sit" position in order to reach the food.
Teaching your dog to fetch（拿、捡） promotes（促进） bonding（关系）.To do this, first throw a ball,
and give the command（命令）"fetch".
As he starts to run towards（ 向，朝着） it, yell "fetch" gain.Instead of a ball,
you may use the object your dog loves most. Do not play fetch with heavy（重的） items or sticks（棍）,
however, as this can damage（损坏） the dog's teeth（牙齿） or injure（弄伤） the dog.
A well-trained dog should remain（逗留） where his owner commands,
so "stay"（停留） is an important command in dog training as well. Since it is more involved（复杂）,
that will be the subject of another article（文章）. Dog training is a very physical activity,
so be prepared（准备） to be tired. And dog training is never without risk of injury（受伤的风险）,
especially（尤其） with more aggressive（好斗的） dogs.
One major（重大的） mistake（错误） many dog owners make is to think that the
dog training is over. Training your dog continues（持续） throughout（遍及） your dog's life.
