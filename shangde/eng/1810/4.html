Relationship between Parents and Children The evidence(和谐) for harmony(和谐)
may not be obvious(明显的) in some families.
But it seems that four out of five young people now get on with their parents.()
An important new study into teenage attitudes surprisingly shows

a researcher comments,"the normal situation through out history has been a
