一二三:
OThe English language is used by more peoplein the world than any other language today.
This may seem surprising at first. After all, the population of English native speakers mainly from United
Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia and NewZealand) is one of the smallest in the world.
The total only comes to about 400 million, which is less than one-tenth of the population of the world.
If we count all the English-speakers in India, Singapore and some other countries,
that adds another 700 millionto the total.
Add all those people who speak English else where and the total English-speaking
population of the world comes to an impressive(印象深刻) one and a half billion.

2Why is this? There is one important historical reason: the influence of(...的影响)
the British Empire-the Empire(帝国) that stretched across the globe.
Althoughthe Empire no longer exists,
the English languageis firmly(坚固的) rooted in its former(以前的) colonies(殖民地) in African, India, Pakistan,
Bangladesh, the Far East,Australia, New Zealand, the Caribbean and NorthAmerica.

3Other important reasons for the spread(传播) of English language are economic(经济).
English is the language of international business and commerce.Also,
most scientific and technological developments have been made by English-speaking societies.
To keep up with such developments, to talk about them in international conferences(会议), or write
and read about them in scientific journals and books, scientists,
scholars and students must be able to understand English.

4There is also a rather less obvious(明显的) reason. English is the language of a popular culture.
All over the globe, millions of young people listen to pop music and watch pop videos.
The stars who performin(表演) English are by far the most famous. Hundreds of American and British
singers can be heard all overthe world. English has become an international language.

English is well suited to this role. Unlike many other languages,
it has a built-in flexibility (RiE't) that allows constant adaptation (2XZѬ) and assimilation ([@]1b) .
In English, vocabulary(词汇) from other languages is often used, new words and
combinations(组合) of words can be coined (tIt#) easily,nouns can be turned into verbs and vice versa.
Thus, what is correct in English is often, simply, what is accepted(公认的) as appropriate and understandable
by those who speak it, whether they are native or non-native speakers.
