Natural(自然) Resources(资源)

Throughout history, people have often selected(挑选) where they want to live based on
the natural resources that are available(可用的) in the area. ()
Some of these resources include(包括) water, food sources(来源) such as fruits and vegetables,
and animals that can be caught(捕捉) or hunted(狩猎).
A region's(地区) natural resources determine(决定) the way of life of its people.()
On the other hand,poor(贫瘠的) soil(土地) will either send people looking for better places,
or attract(吸引) people with other purposes for the land(土地), such as setting up businesses or factories(工厂).
() People who wish(希望) to make a livingas fishermen(渔夫) can do so by the ocean,
but cannot do SO in the desert(沙漠). Desert people have many traditional(传统的) and unique(第一无二) foods,
which can not be found in the forest(深林). Each area attracts people based on their interests and purposes.
Areas that have rich water resources will naturally have more people.
Traditionally, villages(村庄), towns(城镇) and cities built near water havebeen the most successful.
People there are able to use the water resources to meet their daily needs.
() Places that are hard to reach(到达),such as high mountains(山) or dry(干旱) deserts,
will have fewer people living in them.
()For too long, people have destroyed(破坏) natural resources,
using up those resources that cannot be easily replaced.
On the earth, we are lucky to have many resources that are renewable, such as sun, wind, water, and trees.
As more and more focus(重点) is placed on the use of renewable resources,
it will become easier to protect(保护) our planet(地球) from further(更远的) harm(伤害).
