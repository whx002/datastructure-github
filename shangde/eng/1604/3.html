How to Forgive(原谅), Forget and Let Go

1. Forgiving someone does not mean releasing(解脱) them from an earlier guilt(罪行).
What if the person who wronged(冤枉) you is not living?
What if the person is someone who made you extremely(非常) embarrassed(尴尬) during school 20 or 30 years ago?
Letting go of emotional pain(痛苦) does not mean that nothing happened;
it means that you no longer want to be controlled by it.

2. Recognize(认识/意识到) that forgiveness is not denial(否认).Whatever caused the pain was a real incident(事件).
Denying(否认) that it happened means it is too painful to work through the emotions.
There is no time line on forgiveness. Some steps take longer to get through,
and it is acceptable to set them aside for a period of time(一段时间). Part of forgiveness is
understanding whether or not someone takes responsibility(责任) for what happened,and may even show regret(懊悔).

3. Understand that not everyone who forgives reconciles(和解) with the person who caused the pain.
There are relationships that are harmful(有害的) and even physically dangerous.
While it is possible(可能) to forgivethe past and move be yond it,
it may also mean that the person who was involved(v.牵扯/adj.复杂的) can no longer play an active role in your life.
If a person or situation(情况) is not safe, it may be best not to reconcile the relationship now.
Work on forgiveness at a time when you are emotionally healthy and physically safe.

4. Make a conscious(意识到) decision to forgivesomeone. Even if they never apologize(道歉) for what happened,
determine(决心) with in yourself that it is fine(令人满意的) to proceed without this apology.
Apologies should not be asking for forgiveness. Apologies should be offered as an effort(努力的) of true regret.
They should be admitting(承认) that taking personal responsibility for the situation is important.
Even without that apology,make up your mind to(下定你的决心) forgive, forget, and eventually let go.
