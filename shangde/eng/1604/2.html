一二三:
Those Who Ride(骑) on Two Wheels(车轮)

In the United States there are six million tennis(网球) players and twelve million golfers(高尔夫手).
These figures(数字) would not surprise most people.
But many would be surprised to learn that twenty million Americans ride motorcycles (摩托车) ,
few people realize that motorcycling is fast becoming one of America's most popular sports.

According to the Cycle News, many kinds of people enjoy motorcycling.
They include(包括) black peopleand white people, businessmen, professionals, andblue-collar(衣领) workers.
A mong them, about 55% are businessmen, 3% are in the professions and 9% in government(政府) service.

Such information is offered by the Cycle News in the hope of
improving the general(普通的) public(大众的)'s impression(影响) of the sport.
The public has tended to believe that all motorcyclists are wild(野蛮) and lawless(无法无天) young men.

There are several things about motorcycling that the average(普通/平均) citizen(市民) dislikes
and motorcyclist's appearance(外观) has something to do with this dislike.
Motorcyclists often look dirty(肮脏); in fact, they are dirty.
On the road, there is little to(几乎没有) protect(保护) them from mud(泥).For practical(真实的) reasons,
they often dress in old clothing which looks much less respectable than the
clothingof people who ride in cars. For the same reason,

motorcyclists usually wear dark(深色) colors.
Perhaps(也许) this helps to explain(解释/说明) why they are sometimes suspected(怀疑) of having bad natures.

Probably motorcycles themselves also produc eanger(愤怒) and fear(恐惧). They are noisy(噪音),
though some trucks(卡车) are even noisier.
But trucks are acceptable(可接受的) because they perform(执行) a needed service. Motorcycles,
on the other hand, make an uncomfortable noise just to give their riders pleasure(满足/快乐).
Roaring(喧闹的) along quiet streets, they wake(唤醒) sleeping families and make babies cry(哭).

Yet, as motorcycling becomes more and more common,
it will be interesting to see how people in general feel about the sport.
Perhaps it will some day become as "respectable" as tennis or golf.
