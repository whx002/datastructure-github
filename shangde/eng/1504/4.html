The Speed of Americans
Americans love speed. They like to cook in microwave ovens.
They prefer making phone calls to writing letters. When they send a package,
they want it to arrive tomorrow, not nextweek.
Offering a quick service is a sure way to make money in the States.
One of the biggest of them, Federal Express, 
will delivera computer disk in just a few hours to a forgetful
business man who left his bag behind. And if anyone wants to say "I'm sorry," or "I love you,
'or "Happy birthday," Roseland Express will send a dozen fresh roses anywhere in the U.S.A.
within twelve hours.Not everyone in the States likes speed, though.
The Amish people in Pennsylvania and the Midwest still use the clock in the eighteenth century.
They still live in the unhurried style of those days, refusing to use cars, telephones,
televisions,or any other modern invention. In their his torical clothes and horse-drawn carriages,
they are living reminders of the slower life of earlier times.
Few Americans live in such peace as the Amish people enjoy.
Nearly half the population moves at least once every five years,
and some more often than that. Most people move to a suburb or town nearby,
but many pack all their furniture and belongs and move to the other side of America.
A girl who has grown up in Chicago might study in NewYork, and find her first job in Philadelphia.
She might move to California to look for better work, marry aman from Des Moines,
and move back to near hisfamily in lowa. At last, when her children have grownup,
she might get tired of the cold winters and retireto Florida 
to spend her old age sitting in the sun.
By this time next year, he might have moved to Maryland, or Michigan, or Minnesota.
In fact, Americans are always on the move.
Some people, in fact, refuse to be hurried.
They like to travel by air rather than bus or train.
Fast-delivery companies are getting more business all the time.
Most Americans move their homes because of the changes in their work.
