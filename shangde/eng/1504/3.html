Changes in Marriage

OThere are several factors that influenced womenduring the Victorian age to marry.
Many of them were a result of lack of choice.
Firstwe need to deal with education to understand whywomen married.
Women were left uneducated inmany areas of life.
They had no control over theireducation and were only taught about domestic duties.
Starting at a young age, they were taught thata woman should get married and have children.
They were born, raised and educated to become wives andnothing else. A woman was not expected to work
unless she was in the lower class and had no choice.

2The development from Victorian marriage tomodern marriage was a
slow process. In the 1960s,women began to exercise their power and freedommore publicly.
Women began to marry for happiness.Women began to work more and more outside of thehome,
and during the war time when their husbandsleft to war,
they were asked to take on more jobs thattheir husbands had left behind.

3Beginning in the 1840s,
a series of laws werepassed that began to allow women in marriage tohave a bit more control.
In 1839 the Infant and ChildCustody Act allowed women to take custodyof
their children under the age of seven if divorced orseparated.
In 1857, ordinary divorce was establishedin England through the Divorce Act. In 1870, the
Married Women's Property Act allowed for womento keep their earnings and even inherit personal
properties and money. Slowly but surely, women weregaining control over themselves,
their children andtheir possessions.

4Divorce, unlike during the Victorian period, isa lot more acceptable.
Now when a couple gets adivorce, the woman is
more likely to get the custodyof her children than the man.
Divorce is now seen as away to get out of marriage as a
result of any type ofunhappiness.

5Women these days have a lot more control overtheir marriages than they used to.
A woman is freeto marry who she wants
for the most part. She canchoose to be married as well as have a career.
If awoman is unable to have kids, there are
many waysthat would help her. Even choosing not to have kids isnot looked down upon as it used to be.
