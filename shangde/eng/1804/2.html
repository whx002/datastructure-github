Christmas Gift

Mary didn't know what to send to her grandparents for Christmas.
lt was always hard to choose a good Christmas present(礼物) for them.
They didn't need much, and it was hard for her to be creative every year.
One year, she sent them a big wooden(木质) elephant(大象). lt sat on the counter(柜台) for a year,
but then it disappeared, probably into a closet(壁橱) some where.
Another year, she made hand made soaps(肥皂) with nice smells(气味),
but they probably weren't any better than store-bought soaps.
Last year, she sent lots of nice pictures of herself in frames, but grandparents' house was small,
and they couldn't hang up very many. This year, she decided on fruit.
She lived where it was warm and there was lots of nice fruit.
Her grandparents lived up north, where it was colder andt hey couldn't get fresh fruit all year,
or at least notoranges and grapefruit. Fresh fruit was healthy for her grandparents, too.

Mary went to a fruit store and sampled(品尝) the red oranges. She really liked them and bought a kilogram.
Then she tried three kinds of grapefruit. The white ones were sour(酸).
The star grapefruit were interesting,but the dark red grapefruit were great. So she got a kilogram.
Mary carefully packed the fruit in a box to keep them safe and 
dry(干的) in case one got smashed(破碎) and its juice(果汁) got everywhere.
Then she wrote the addresson(地址) the box and mailed(邮寄) it from the store. She felt happy with what she bought.

A few days later, Mary got a phone call from her grandparents, thanking her for the lovely fruit.
They said it was a healthy, tasty(美味的), and very thoughtful gift.Mary had never felt so good before.
