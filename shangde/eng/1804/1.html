Life on the Farm

Life on a farm is always changing. New technologies and a rising(提升) interest in healthier and
organic(有机的) eating have had a huge impact(影响) on how farms do business.
At the same time, a growing population(人口) has put more demands(需求) on farmers.
They need to find ways to increase(增长) their production levels(水平).
Thes mall family farms that used to produce most ofthe products have been largely replaced by factory farms.
Small family farms that are still operating(运作) are struggling(努力) to keep up(保持).

Technology has made most aspects(方面) of farm life easier than it has ever been before.
Bigger and more .efficient(高效的) equipment(设备) makes work
such as (plowing up fields)(耕种田地) and sowing(播种) the seeds(种子) easier.
Such tasks used to take two or three times as long.
These advances have allowed(允许) farmers to work faster and more efficiently than ever before.

In addition to(除...之外) newer technology,
factory farms produce more products for less money than traditional farming would require.

Modern farm life, despite(尽管) the introduction of(引入) new technologies,
has not changed much from what it has always been. Farmers still wake up(起床) early, and spend their days doing hard
work.
There are still animals to feed(饲养), cows to be milked, and fields to be plowed.
Farm life still requires a lot of hard work and sacrifice(牺牲).

The main change in modern farm life is in the way farms are run.
lt is common for even small farms to have several hired(雇佣) workers and even an animal manager(管理员).
Family-run farms are becoming rarer(更稀少).

Factory farms, with other larger farm corporations(公司),are becoming the norm.
Although there are still many traditional family farms,
they are quickly dying(消亡的) as modern practices(实践) change farm life forever(永远).
